# Howdy!
I'm an anthropologist by training, and have worked for 15 years in higher education and the non-profit world, both in the US and abroad. I'm lucky to call Montana home - where I can indulge in skiing, fishing, backpacking, and exploring the back roads. I love to travel and wrench on old cars. I like solving problems. 
# Why Web Development?
## Changing careers
* I'm looking for flexibility and new challenges
* Travel is a high priority for our family, so I'd like a career that I can take anywhere
## Evolving Skills
* I'm a project-oriented worker, and I like building things
* I have always been engaged with technology - my parents bought a *Macintosh SE* in the late 1980s when I was a kid. I remember writing some of my first homework assignments in Claris, and using **Hypercard**!
