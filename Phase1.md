# Howdy!
I'm an anthropologist by training, and have worked for 15 years in higher education and the non-profit world, both in the US at abroad. I'm lucky to call Montana home - where I can indulge in skiing, fishing, backpacking, and exploring the back roads. I love to travel and wrench on old cars. I like solving problems.
